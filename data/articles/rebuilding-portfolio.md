<start>There were a lot of things</start> I didn't like about my previous portfolio. The biggest issues were that I overestimated how much content that was needed to finish my website. 

For some reference, check out my [old portfolio](https://jasonyeung-old.netlify.com).

#### ~~Case Studies~~ → Articles
Intially, I decided to add case studies to every project to showcase my thought process — it was a *nightmare* to do. I rushed haphazardly to finish them off so I could publish the site as soon as possible. [Just look at an example](https://jasonyeung-old.netlify.com/case-studies/do-you-love-fluffy/). 

The case studies were simply too long, unfocused, and unfinished. 
In the end, it left a really bad taste in my mouth now that I'm read them again.

The Solution? **Articles!** Instead of having full-fledged case studies, I decided to create a simple articles for my portfolio (what you're reading right now!). It lets me write anything I want while not having to worry about a 10 page case study for one miniscule project.

### What's next?
**Projects**. Although I feel have the skills as developer, it certainly doesn't look like it.
